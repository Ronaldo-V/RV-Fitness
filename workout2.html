                    <h2>Weight Lifting</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is the best way to burn fat and build muscle at the same time. Whether you want a lean physique, want bigger muscles or want just want to see how heavy you can lift and focus on strength training, it doesn't matter which one you prefer, they are all good viable options.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Muscular endurance is the ability to perform repetitive contractions against a force for an extended period of time for any given muscle. The greater your muscular endurance the higher number of repetitions you could complete. Typically, the weight will be lighter and the repetitions completed will be 15+.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Strength training is the opposite of muscular endurance. It is all about lifting weights close to your maximum capabilities, for very little repetitions. Normally you will perform 1-6 reps at a weight 85%+ of the total weight you can lift (1RM). For example, if you can Squat 100kg for a single repetition or rep as commonly referred to, then in strength training, you would lift at least 85% of that, which would be 85kg and you would perform anywhere between 1-6 reps.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want a lean physique, you can opt for endurance training, strength training, or a combination of both, it is entirely up to you and your preferene.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, Hypertrophy. This is the correct term used instead of 'bulking' when you are training to increase muscle size. For this, you aim to complete 8-12 reps of a weight 65% - 85% of your max weight.
                    </p>
